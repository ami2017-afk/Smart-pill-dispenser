# Smart-pill-dispenser

# Problem statement

Medication non-adherence is a significant healthcare issue, leading to poor health outcomes and increased healthcare costs.Patients often forget to take their prescribed medications on time, leading to missed doses and compromised treatment effectiveness.Existing solutions for medication reminders lack smart features and may not effectively address the needs of patients with complex medication regimens.

# Proposed system

Develop a smart pill dispenser system integrated with a mobile app to ensure timely and accurate medication adherence.Utilize a combination of hardware components, including Arduino, NodeMCU, servomotor, RTC (Real-Time Clock), IR sensor, power supply, and a buzzer, to create the smart pill dispenser.Implement a mobile app with features such as medication scheduling, reminders, and real-time monitoring of pill dispensing.Integrate the app with the smart dispenser through Wi-Fi connectivity (NodeMCU), enabling remote control and monitoring.

# Requirements

1.Arduino: Used to control and manage the hardware components of the smart pill dispenser.

2.NodeMCU (ESP8266): Provides Wi-Fi connectivity, enabling communication between the dispenser and the mobile app.

3.Servomotor: Mechanism for dispensing pills accurately and securely.

4.RTC (Real-Time Clock): Ensures precise timekeeping and scheduling of medication doses.

5.IR Sensor: Detects when a user approaches the dispenser for pill retrieval, triggering the dispenser's operation.

6.Power Supply: Provides a stable power source to the dispenser and other components.

7.Buzzer: Generates audible alerts to notify users when it's time to take their medication.

# Conclusion

A smart pill dispenser, integrated with a mobile app, addresses the problem of medication non-adherence by providing timely reminders and a user-friendly interface for managing medication schedules.The combination of Arduino, NodeMCU, servomotor, RTC, IR sensor, power supply, and buzzer forms a comprehensive solution to ensure patients take their medication as prescribed, ultimately improving health outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.
